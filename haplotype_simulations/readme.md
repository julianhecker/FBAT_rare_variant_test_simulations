## tool to perform the haplotype simulation study described in "An exact, unifying framework for rare variant association testing in family-based designs, including higher criticism approaches, SKATs, multivariate and burden tests" (Hecker et al. 2020)

- haps= haplotype file containing the haplotypes for the simulation (nvar=1000, nhaps=1006). Haplotypes were extracted from the EUR set of the 1000 Genomes phase3 dataset.
- assumes file "haps" is in this same folder. Performs the FBAT tests, as well as gTDT and RV-TDT BRV (see below for references)

- how to run simulations: (number of replicates set to 100 in main.cpp)

*./main seed number_trios number_causal_variants index_1_causal_variant ... index_last_causal_variant effect_size_1 ... effect_size_last*

**CAUTION: no index checking, relies heavily on reasonable input data. No input checking!**

- example scenario 1 in the manuscript:

*./main 1 1000 2 494 924 1.8 1.8*
